Variables:

Data:
The data sets can be splitted into a test set and a training set. The data could be splitted that way possibly to perform machine learning operations on it.
Within each test and training set, the data is then splitted in the following manner:
1) a file that contains the unique identity of each experimental subject (each data point corresponding to a row)
2) a file describing the activity the subject was performing
3) a file containing the various measurements of the subject while performing the activity
4) an additional file containing more measurements of the subject
